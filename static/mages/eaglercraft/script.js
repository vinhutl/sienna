Minecraft Style Menu & Buttons

As I'm not Pro here and CORS don't let me upload and use the font in any host where try, you would have to trust me that it looks good!

Or you can download the font made by Alex Gabites yourself from here:
https://github.com/South-Paw/Minecraft-Webfont-and-Colors/tree/master/font

--- Edit ---
I used the custom font from Ace_Monkey_Ilium Minecraft Starting Screen pen.
